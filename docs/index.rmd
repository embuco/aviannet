# 2018 Day of Civic Hacking Project <br> (Sat. 11 Aug)
(last update 2018-06-20)

A civic hacking project to develop AI/ML workflow to detect aerial survey photos containing birds.

## Introduction 

(time: <1 min)

With the increasing accessibility to remote sensing, the is a growing need to be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to aid in the processing and analysis of images. Cameras are being deployed with aerial bird surveys and producing gigabytes to terabytes of images. A first step in processing this data is the time consuming and tedious effort of sorting out pictures of empty terrain from those containing birds.

It appears reasonable that with existing AI/ML techniques a workflow could be created to teach and execute an AI system to filter images from aerial surveys. To begin the work on this process members of the Patuxent US FWS and USGS Community will host a Day of Civic Hacking on Saturday 11 August 2018.

This webpage and it’s subpages (cellphones see upper right) are intended to inform and coordinate interested humans (or nonhuman AI’s) about the day of civic hacking event, the follow up in the months after, and a landing page for final results.
